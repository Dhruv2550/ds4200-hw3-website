Styling & Customizations:
1.	Custom Font & Typography:
	The site uses the "Inter" font loaded via Google Fonts.
	Applied consistent font weights for headings and body text for better readability and a modern look.
	Headings (h1, h2, h3) are distinguished by size and accent color to establish hierarchy.

2.	Color Scheme & Visual Theme:
	Implemented a dark color palette using CSS variables for background, text, accent, and card elements.
	Accent color (#6b8cff) is used for headings, links, and hover effects to guide user focus.
	Cards and sections have slightly different background shades to create depth.

3.	Layout & Spacing:
	Used flexbox for layout in the intro section to align text and images side-by-side.
	Added custom margins, padding, and rounded corners to containers and images for a clean, modern look.
	Box shadows applied to cards and images to create depth and subtle separation from background.

4.	Navigation Enhancements:
	Sticky header with drop shadow ensures navigation is always accessible.
	Navigation links have hover color transitions to improve interactivity.

5.	Responsive Design:
	Media queries adjust layout for screens smaller than 700px.
	On mobile, images shrink and text stacks vertically for better readability.
	Ensures the site is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

6.	Additional Features:
	Alt text for all images improves accessibility.
	Semantic HTML (header, main, section, footer) improves structure and SEO.
	Footer with copyright information completes the site.
