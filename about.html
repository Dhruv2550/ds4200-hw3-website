      <h2>Building with Data and Code</h2>

      <p>
        Over the past year, I’ve been developing interactive projects that combine design, data,
        and storytelling. One of my favorite experiences was creating a Stock Simulator app that
        helps users practice buying and selling stocks while visualizing their portfolio in real
        time. It follows a Model-View-Controller design, which made the program more organized
        and scalable. Through this, I learned a lot about object-oriented programming and how
        small design choices can influence user experience.
      </p>

        I also explore data visualization with D3.js — transforming raw CSV files into insightful
        charts. Whether it’s a bar chart comparing product sales or a time-series line plot showing
        trends, I enjoy turning data into something meaningful and visually appealing. In the future,
        I hope to combine these technical skills with design thinking to build applications that
        help people make informed decisions.
